# Text Classification with Gemini Embeddings and Keras

Welcome to the **Text Classification with Gemini Embeddings and Keras** project! This repository demonstrates how to classify newsgroup posts into categories using embeddings generated by the **Gemini API** and a **Keras model**. By leveraging pre-trained embeddings, this approach achieves high performance with relatively few training examples compared to training a text model from scratch.

## Overview

This project uses the **20 Newsgroups dataset**, which contains 18,000 newsgroup posts across 20 topics. The goal is to classify these posts into their respective categories based on their content. The workflow involves:

1. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
2. **Embedding Generation**: Using the **Gemini API** to generate embeddings for each post.
3. **Model Training**: Building and training a simple Keras model to classify the posts.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on a test dataset.
5. **Custom Predictions**: Making predictions on new, unseen data.

## Features

- **Efficient Embedding Generation**: Utilizes the **Gemini API** to generate high-quality embeddings tailored for classification tasks.
- **Simple Keras Model**: A lightweight neural network with one hidden layer for classification.
- **Modular Design**: Code is organized into reusable modules for preprocessing, embedding generation, and model training.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for other datasets or classification tasks.
